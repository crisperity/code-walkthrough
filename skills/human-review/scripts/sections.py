cannot go missing or get paraphrased by whoever assembles the page. A renderer inserts this
output verbatim; it does not rewrite it.

The first line of the output is an HTML comment marker, `<!-- visual-diff:symbols -->`, which
survives GitHub's sanitizer and renders as nothing. validate_analysis.py --sections uses it to
prove the section actually reached the rendered file.

emitted.

    fan sideways -- the wrong axis for a phone -- where LR grows it downward and the page just
    scrolls. Mermaid has no live collapse/expand of its own, so each level is a complete diagram
    rather than one graph the reader folds. `moved` is rendered as prose, not as graph nodes: a
    symbol that only changed package sits outside the diff, and its callers -- not its own
    address -- are what a call-graph edge is about. A package-level move edge was tried and
    removed because it breaks the containment layout: dagre has to place the vacated package
    outside the box it used to nest in, and the arrow crosses the whole diagram to reach it.

    The symbols level draws a changed symbol only if it takes part in its edges: most
    changed symbols have no changed call edge, and dagre lays out every edge-less node in one
    wide rank (measured on a real PR: 25 such nodes side by side, each as wide as its
