"""Draft -> posted lifecycle for state.json's notes[], targeted at a GitHub PR.

  python3 notes.py sync --state state.json  (< gh api .../pulls/<n>/comments --paginate)
  python3 notes.py sync-threads --state state.json  (< gh api graphql for REVIEW_THREADS_QUERY)
  python3 notes.py import --state state.json [--file payload.json]  (< pasted JSON on stdin)
  python3 notes.py deliver --state state.json --id <local> [--diff raw.diff]
  python3 notes.py submit --state state.json --event COMMENT|APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES \
      --body-file <f>
  python3 notes.py reanchor --state state.json --diff raw.diff

  Superseded, kept for one release (see "GitHub delivery" below):
  python3 notes.py payloads --state state.json --commit-id <sha> --out <dir>
  python3 notes.py promote --state state.json --id <local> --gh-id <id> --gh-url <url>

notes.py never calls git. `gh` is the one subprocess it runs, and only for `deliver` and
`submit`, always `gh api graphql` with the request body on stdin (see "GitHub delivery").
Everything else here is a pure state transformer over state.json's notes[] array (schema:
docs/plans/code-walkthrough/PLAN.md, "The state document").

Lifecycle is draft -> posted. A record is never deleted and never rewritten in place by any
other step; a failed post leaves the note a draft, so nothing is lost.

sync ingests `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments --paginate` output from stdin.
--paginate concatenates one JSON array per page rather than merging them, so stdin may hold
several back-to-back JSON documents; read_paginated_json handles that without a `jq -s`
round trip. `line === null` is GitHub's outdated-comment signal (empirically confirmed, see
state.md): the comment is kept with `line = original_line` and `stale = true`.
`position`/`original_position` are never stored, they're unreliable. `diff_hunk` and
`original_commit_id` are stored verbatim -- the hunk and the commit sha it came from, together
enough to render the outdated snippet a stale comment refers to (`head_sha` is the wrong commit
for that by definition). `in_reply_to_id` resolves to the parent's local id when
the parent is already in state; otherwise the raw gh id is kept on `reply_to_gh_id` and
re-tried on every sync, since `--paginate` does not guarantee parent-before-child order. A
reply always inherits its parent's `line`/`side`.

sync-threads is a second, additive sync pass over a different `gh` shape: the REST payload
`sync` reads has no review-thread node id, so resolving a conversation (a GraphQL-only
operation, `resolveReviewThread`) needs this pass to learn each thread's id before the page can
ever show a Resolve button. Run it after `sync`, from the query's own response on stdin:

  gh api graphql -f query='REVIEW_THREADS_QUERY' -F owner=<owner> -F repo=<repo> -F number=<n> | \
    python3 notes.py sync-threads --state state.json

REVIEW_THREADS_QUERY (below, next to the delivery mutations) walks
`repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes` for `id`, `isResolved`, `resolvedBy { login }`, and
each thread's `comments.nodes[].databaseId`, then sync_threads maps every thread onto the notes
whose gh_id (the REST-style integer `sync` already stored) matches one of those databaseIds,
setting `gh_thread_id`, `resolved`, and `resolved_by` (the resolver's login, or None when
unresolved) on each; an unresolve clears `resolved_by` along with `resolved` rather than leaving
a stale name behind. Idempotent like `sync`: matched by gh_id, so replaying
the same response twice is a no-op the second time. `first: 100` on both connections rather than
`--paginate`, since a nested connection (comments inside each thread) has its own cursor that
--paginate's outer-cursor convention does not reach; a PR with over 100 threads or over 100
comments in one thread needs a second call, not attempted here.

import merges a page's Copy for agent payload into state.json: the page is a plain local
file with no server to post a click to, so pasting the copied JSON here is the only way a
marked note reaches state.json. It goes through merge_state with is_page_origin=True, the
same deny-list a page write is always subject to (PAGE_DENIED_NOTE_FIELDS and VALID_ID_RE): a
pasted payload is a snapshot of localStorage and can be stale, and without that deny-list a
note state.json already has as posted would flip back to draft, sending the next deliver to
open a second thread on the same line. A note brand new to state.json gets the deny-list's
fields defaulted by merge_state itself (state "draft", origin "local", etc), but only once
merge_state has confirmed it carries a path/line/side -- a malformed paste is dropped instead
of being written to state.json half-formed, since pending_publish_ids would otherwise raise on
it on every later import. Its "ready to post" list is exactly pending_publish_ids restricted
to the notes this call touched, not a second definition of ready.

GitHub delivery (deliver/submit) goes through a GraphQL pending review instead of the old
REST payloads/promote pair, because REST has no way to append a comment to an
already-created review and secondary rate limits punish one-comment-per-click. `deliver`
opens the pending review lazily on its first call -- its id is looked up fresh every time
rather than stored, so a review submitted from the web UI mid-session can never strand us on
a stale id -- then either replies into an existing thread (`addPullRequestReviewComment`,
when the note has a `reply_to`/`in_reply_to` whose parent already carries a `gh_node_id`) or
opens a new one (`addPullRequestReviewThread`, after resolving the anchor -- see
`postable_ranges`/`resolve` below). A null thread/comment back from a reply attempt means the
web UI deleted that thread mid-session, not an error: `deliver` falls back to opening a fresh
thread instead. The GitHub post and the local state update happen in the same call, so a
crash between the two can never lose the record of a comment that landed. `do_deliver` also
refuses to re-deliver a note already `state == "posted"`, so retrying `deliver` after a `gh`
timeout (the natural response to it) can't double-post a thread whose first attempt actually
landed -- see GH_TIMEOUT above. `submit` publishes the pending review with
`submitPullRequestReview`, and `do_submit` raises if that comes back null (a silently rejected
submission) rather than reporting success. Every `gh` call sends its query and
variables as one JSON document on stdin via `gh api graphql --input -`: a note body is
authored by a browser page, and interpolating that text into a command line would be shell
injection with an extra step. Notes carry `gh_thread_id` and `gh_node_id` beside the existing
`gh_id` (the REST-style integer, requested via `databaseId`), since a reply addresses a
GraphQL node rather than a REST id.

postable_ranges/resolve (anchor resolution) exist because GitHub's GraphQL mutations return
200 with a null thread and no error for a line outside any hunk -- the comment is silently
discarded rather than rejected. `deliver` resolves every anchor against the diff before
sending: unchanged when the line is still in a hunk, the nearest in-hunk line on the same
side when one is within `NEAREST_LINE_LIMIT`, otherwise a file-level thread. Either moved
case appends a short note to the body saying so. Never called from the page, only from
`deliver`, since the page's own diff can be stale by the time a comment actually posts.

payloads/promote are the REST-era pair, kept working for one release: payloads emits one
JSON object per pending draft note (see pending_publish_ids below): {body, commit_id, path,
line, side} for a top-level comment, {body, in_reply_to} for a reply. `side` is copied
verbatim from the record and never re-derived here -- posting a LEFT line as RIGHT lands the
comment on unrelated code.

reanchor rebinds a note's `line` near its old position after the diff has moved, by matching
`anchor_text` (the diff line's verbatim text, captured at wire time) against the new diff.
The search never crosses sides: a LEFT note only searches removed lines, a RIGHT note only
added and context lines, and a rebind never changes `side`. No match, or a too-trivial
anchor, means `stale: true` and the old `line`/`anchor_line` are left alone -- never guessed.

Stdlib only, no network beyond `gh`.
