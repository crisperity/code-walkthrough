# crisperit-skills

Skills I want to share with you. Agent skills I use on real work, packaged so
you can install them.

One skill lives here today: **visual-diff**.

## visual-diff

Point it at a git diff, a commit range, a branch or a GitHub PR. It produces a
markdown recap for the PR description and a self-contained HTML review page you
open locally.

```
/visual-diff                 # working tree plus staged changes
/visual-diff this branch     # main...HEAD
/visual-diff 123             # that PR
/visual-diff HEAD~3..HEAD
```

### Why

The point is not prettier output. The point is making a human review faster and
more thorough, because that is still where real defects get caught.

When I review a PR by hand I do the same three things every time, and all three
are manual work the diff does nothing to help with:

**1. I group the changed files by feature and read them in that order.** A
GitHub file list is alphabetical, which is never the order the change makes
sense in. So visual-diff groups the files into themes, puts the theme a reviewer
needs first at the top, and orders files inside a group caller before callee.

**2. I estimate coupling by reading what imports what.** That is how you find
the blast radius of a change, and doing it by hand across seven files is slow
and easy to get wrong. visual-diff derives the import and call graph from the
code, not from prose, and draws it at two levels. Packages first:

![Package level relations](docs/images/coupling-packages.png)

Then the same graph at symbol level, so you can see which new function actually
has fan-out and which are leaves:

**3. I take notes per line, then turn them into review comments.** The page lets
you comment on any diff line and copy the whole set back out, ready to post on
the PR.

Anything else a reviewer does in their head is a candidate for being
materialized on the page. If you have a habit like these three, open an issue; a
review aid that saves a human ten minutes per PR is worth building.

### The rest of the page

A facts strip, a summary, and a mermaid flow diagram of the change:

Each file carries a one-line role, each hunk a note on what the code does, above
the diff itself:

The screenshots above come from a small demo Python service, on a branch adding
recurring expenses and a budget forecast.

Nothing is published. The page stays a local file unless you pass `--pr` or ask
for it to be hosted.

### Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| (default) | both outputs, markdown recap and HTML page |
| `--md-only` | skip the HTML page |
| `--html-only` | skip the markdown |
| `--recap-only` | prose only, no graphs, cheapest run |
| `--pr [<number>]` | also write the recap into the PR description |

### Prerequisites

- `python3`, standard library only, nothing to install
- `git`
- `gh`, only to target a PR or post comments
- optional, for the graphs: `tree-sitter-language-pack`, `go`, or a language
  server, depending on the language. See below.

### Language support

The parts built from the diff itself work on any repo, whatever the language:
the grouping and reading order, the annotated walkthrough, per-line comments,
the markdown recap and the flow diagram.

The graphs have to parse the code, so they are per language:

| Graph | Languages | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| module map, file import graph | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go | nothing |
| symbol graph and complexity in the recap | Python | nothing |
| symbol graph and complexity in the recap | TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift, Scala, C, C++, C#, PHP, Lua, Elixir, Julia | `pip install tree-sitter-language-pack` |
| interactive symbol level graph on the page | Go | `go` on PATH |
| interactive symbol level graph on the page | Python, TypeScript, TSX, Rust | `pyright-langserver`, `typescript-language-server` or `rust-analyzer` |

On a language that is not in the table, or with the tooling missing, the graph
sections are skipped and the page says so. Nothing else changes.

## Install

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```
/plugin marketplace add crisperit/crisperit-skills
/plugin install crisperit-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Any other harness</strong></summary>

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` in it, so anything that reads that
format picks it up.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crisperit/crisperit-skills.git
cd crisperit-skills
./install.sh                            # ~/.claude/skills
./install.sh ~/.config/some-harness/skills
```

`install.sh` symlinks rather than copies, so `git pull` updates what you have
installed.
